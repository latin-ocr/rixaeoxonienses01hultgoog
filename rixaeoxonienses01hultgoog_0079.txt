T own and Gown. 71 Ι

upon the Town Bell being rung out first, and alter that,
the University Bell, divers scholars issued out armed‚
with bows and arrows in their own delence, and ol their
companions‚ and having first shut and blocked up some
ol the gates ol the town (lest the country people‚ who
were then gathered together in innumerable multi-
tudes might suddenly break in upon their rear in
hostile manner, and assist the townsmen, who were
now ready in battle array, ¹and armed with their
targets also), they lought with them and defended
themselves till alter vesper-tide3 a little alter which
’ time, entered into the town by the West gate about
two thousand countrymen with a black dismal flag,
erect and displayed. Oi which the scholars having
notice, and being unable to resist so great and fierce
a company, they withdrew themselves to their
lodgings' :-

Urebat portas agrestis plebs populosa,
Α Post res distortus videas quae sunt vitiosa

Vexillum geritur nigrum ‘Slea,’ ‘Sleu’ recitatur,
Credunt quod moritur Rex, vel quod sic humilietur,

Clamant ‘Havoclr’ et ‘Havoclr’3 non sit qui salvificetnr
‘Smyt last, give gode knocks’ nullus post baec dominetur.
Thus part ol a piece ol poetry made in those times,
concerning the said conflict The townsmen, finding
no scholars in the streets to make opposition, pursued
them, and that day they broke open five lnns or

Hostles ol scholars with fire and sword:-

Invedunt aulas3 ‘By the sun come lortb' geminantes,
Fregerunt caulas, simul omniu vi spoliantes
