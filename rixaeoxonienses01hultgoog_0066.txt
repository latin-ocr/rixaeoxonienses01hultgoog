58* Rz'xae oxonienses.

Robert of Glo'ucester thus describes the scene.

‘llis way he nome (took) by oxenford, but the burgesses anon

The gates made against him of the town ench one.
He went and lai withoute towne, atte kinge's halle

And went forth amorrow with his men alle.

The gates, when be was went, were elle up brought

⁸ Soon, but Smithe gate, but that was undone not

The clerkes had therethrough mueh soluoe ilore

To play towards Beumond, annoyed they were therefore.
Τὴε bailif they bid oft, to grant their solaee,

To play and undo that gete, but for nought it was.

So that a few wild hinds a h'ght plan therof nome,

And a day after meat with axes thither come,

And that gate to-hew and to-dsshed there,

And after through Beumond to Herewell it bere,

And ‘subvenite saneti' fast began to sing,

As man doth when a dead man men to pitte bring.
William the Spycer and Geffny of Henesei that then were
Portreven, and Nicole of Kingestone that was mayor,

Nome of these clerks and in prison cast,

And would not them deliver, yet the Chaneellor prayed fast.
The clerks were wroth, the burgesses were so bold'

And threatened to nime more, and of their wrath little told.
The first Thursday iu Lent the burgesses were well fers, Ἴ
And, the while men were stte meet, areared two bannens,
And went thern forth armed with all their power there,

To defoul nll the clerks, ere they iware were.

As they came against All Halwen with power so strong

At Seinte Marie churche a clerc the common bell roug.
Those clerks up from their meat, and to Gode's grace truste,
And saw that they were sheut, but they the better them wuste‚
They met with those burgesses and began to shoot fast,
Iwounded there was many one, but the burgesses atte laste
They began to flee fast, thern thought long ere

So that the clerks had the streetes soon clear.

The bowyers’ shops they broke, and the bows nome each one
Afterwards the Portreves honses they set fire anon,

Iu the south half of the town, and afterwards the Spieerie
They broke from end to other and did all to robberie.

For the mayor was rintuer, they broke the vinmerie,

And all other in the town, and that was little masterie.
