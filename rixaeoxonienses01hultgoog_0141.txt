Sluart Oxfhra’. 129

Church and Obadiah Walker, Master os University ;
disregarded the election os Hough by the Fellows os
Magdalen‚ and thrust on them his nominee, Parker‚
Bishop of Oxford. The result os this conduct was
the acquiescence of the University in the Revolution
os 1689, as a necessary evil; its cold but courteous
attitude towards William ΙΙΙ; and the control of its
iaherent Jacobitism till the latter years of Queen Anne.
