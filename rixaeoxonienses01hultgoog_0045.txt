T lte Boules of the Nations. 37

Chaplain or Priest of the said Parish, wherein the Clerk dwelt, was
passing by the window os the lower room carrying with him the Lord's
Body toa certain sick person, whom, when the Devil saw through the
window, he presently at the sight of the Chaplain bent his lrnees with
lifting up oi his hands, continuing in this position, till he had passed by
the place. The Clerk observing this, took special notice of it. Alter-
ward the Clerk proceeded in his questions and discnssed of several
things with the Devil. At length the Chaplain returned without the
Lord's Body, and passing by the same place, the Devil at sight oi him
bent but one knee, which the Clerk noting admired at, and adjured him
to give the reason why he should bend both knees when the Chaplain
went by, and but one lrnee when he returned. To which the Devil
consessed that he was forced whether he would or not, to do it, to the
end that honour might be given to the Lord’s Body as it passed by,
with both lrnees, and to the Chaplain in his return with but one,
because of his reverence and that he was the officer of the Lord. The
Clerk thereupon being much troubled, and concluding with himself
that the Lord's Body was more master oi the Devil than he, (which
without demur the Devil confessed), removed him from tlre place, gave
him hiswages according to the manner, and forthwitb renouncing his

art and skill in necromaney bumt all his boolrs, and repented he had . .

spent so much time therein. ·

About the same time, a certain scholar after he had been labonring at
his boolr all day, went at the usual honr to bed very well and cheeriul,
as scholars used to be alter a good day's work. But in the middle oi
the night agreat noise arose, wherenpon his fellows that laid in the
same chamber being disturbed, arose to see what the matter was, and
straightway found their iellow clerlr grovelling on the ground, mute and
in a manner dead, wherenpon a strange consternation seizing them, one
oi the Clerks said·“ let us go to Prayers, and repeat the beginning of
the Gospel oi St John, for without doubt he is possessed with the nevil?
To which proposal all agreeing and malring answer to him that prayed
and read, the Devil, who had possessed their brother, leit him, and
going down the stonesteps which led to the solar or chamber. leit
behind him such a filthy smell that the Clerks were almost killed by ir?
