sore wounded‚ and died at the house 01 Ralph the
¹ chirurgeon in St. Aldates, the murder “being much

“ the vigils 01 St. John the Baptist, the'tailors 01 Oxford
were wont to keep watch all night in their shops,
singing and taking their solace with harps, viols, and
all kinds 01 music. On this anniversary in 1306,
after midnight they went out 01 their shops and
danced in the High Street opposite the Drapery.
And as they were thus disporting themselves came

one, but he, breaking away from them, would have
cut off the handus William de Claydon‚ as he went in
the dance. Then ran upon him Henry de Beaumont
and wounded him in the hand, and Thomas de
Bloxham struck him pitifully in the back, and William
de Leye felled him to the earth, so that he perished. ,

The obnoxious claims 01 the Papal See, and the
