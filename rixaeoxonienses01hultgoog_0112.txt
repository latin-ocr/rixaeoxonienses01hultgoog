signifying that he and his party were worthy of
hanging3 the good wives of Oxford in their sympathy
for Queen Catherine threatened the life of Nicolas de
Burgo, another royal agent, and thirty of them were
imprisoned in Bocardo.

At length in obedience to the King‚ who advised that
the Junior graduates were‘ unfit on account of their im-
maturity to be consulted in such a grand point, and that
the matter should therefore be referred to the ‘sad, dis-
creet, and substantial men of the University,' the ques-
tion was made over to a committes for decision, and an
answer wrung out by threats aud bribery to the effect
that marriage with the wife of a deceased brother was
contrary to divine and human law, if the former
marriage had been cousummated.

The next five years witnessed the death of Wolsey,
the acknowledgement of the King as head of the
Church and Clergy3 the Act restraining appeals to
Rome3 and the marriage of Henry and Anne Boleyn.
In 1534 the Act 25 Henry VIII, cap. 21, abolished the
authority of the Pope in England and subjected the
monasterius to visitation by royal commission. Under

the Act of Supremacy the King assumed the title of
‘Supreme Head of the Church of England.
