Charles Edward at Culloden. On February 23, 1747, '

Whitmore, Dawes, and Luxmore‚ met at Balliol
College, and aiter entertainment sallied forth 'to the
High Street, shouting ‘ King James,’ ‘Prince Charles
sor ever‚’ and other treasonable words. This happened
about 'seven of the clock in the evening. Now it

His Lord the king and the University. This gentle·
man then, on information received from the waiter,
rose with official and political alacrity‚ and proceeded
into the street in the execution of his duty.
