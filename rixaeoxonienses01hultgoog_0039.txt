before St. Mary's Church about four of the clock in the
asternoon, and fought with arrows in a hostile manner.
In the conflict the Principal os Hart Hall, then Fellow

of Exeter‚ a scholar of St. Alban's Hali, and another ’

of Staple Hall were slain, besides many others who
were wounded. Several Merton men were engaged
in the fight, of whom Mr. John Foster, Principal of
St. Alban’s Hall was the chief ; also Mr. Philip
Dense and Mr. John Wingar, who with their gowns
flung aside were present in the crowd? Riots at
Oxford were so frequent at this time that there were
thoughts of taking away the privileges of the Univer-
sity3 ‘and without doubt it would so have come to
pass, had not Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury,
laboured seasonably with importunate requests to
the contrary!

ln 1580, ‘since several decrees had been made for
the orderly keeping of the act, Dr. MatthewS, Dean'
of Christ Church, who was this year Vice=Chancellor,
resolved to see them severely observed, and loreseeing
some rudeness that was like to be done by the juniors
on Act Monday, kept the door leading to the scaffolds
(built theatrewise at the east end of St. Mary’s
Church) in his own person. And among the divers
academicians that endeavoured to enter, and were by
him repelled‚ was Dr. Hamis, Principal oi Brasenose

College, who, though a Head and consequently en·
titled to a place there, was with scorn (the ¹Vice-
Chancellor being probably in a passion) thrust down?
