‘Jacobite Oxford. 143

Papists, lrish officers, and several notorious Jacobites
were in sanctuary there, and fermenting the spirit
ol rebellion, and drinking publicly and uncontrolledly
the Pretender's benith, and suspecting that they
contemplated an insurrection in conjunction with
the disaffected at Bath and Bristol, it was resolved
to secure their persons. Major General Pepper‚ being
charged with this commission‚ sent one oi his officers,
disguised as a countryman, to Oxlord, to get in· ¹
telligence and view the approaches and principal
posts ol the town, and then began to move himself
with his own regiment ol dragoons, bending his
march towards Bath and Bristol. But on the 5th
of October, being then within seven or eight miles
os Oxiord, instead ol resting, he travelled all night,
and entered the city early next morning. Having
caused his men to alight and fix bayonets‚ he im-
mediately secured all the avenues oi the town, and
· the gates oi every inn and public house. Then
sending lor the Vice·Chancellor, and the Mayor,
he shewed them letters lrorn Secretary Stanhope,
and acquainted thern with his orders, to seize sixteen
or eighteen suspected persons. He desired the
Vice-Chancellor to keep the Fellows and Scholars ,
within College, and declared that il any disturbance
should arise, or there should be any great number

’ ol people in the streets, he would cause his men to

fire upon thern. A search was then commenced.
