Town and Goon. 85

a new Master’s Inception, and trial sermons of
Bachelors of Divinity, from the Dominican Convent to
St. Mary’s Church. Allegations were also made by the
Friars that certain Dominican Doctors had not been
duly summoned to Congregation, and their votes had
not been counted; and that Masters intimidated
scholars from coming to the lectures of the Friars.

A difficulty arose in the attempt to serve the
Chancellor with notice of appeal. ‘After such
notice had been published in the Church of the Friars
Minor during sermon time, and the schools of the
Carmelites, Lawrence de Warwyke, Proctor of the
Friars brought it into the Public Schools and
attempted to read it, but was hindered entrance into
them by some that were deputed by the Chanceilor
for that purpose. He therefore waited till the Chan-
cellor came out, and then stepping forward, thrust
the notice of appeal into the folds of his gown, upon
which the Chanceilor taking it from his bosom, and
looking slightly at it, cast it contemptibly in the dust
with displeasing words spoken against the brethren.'

‘Soon afterwards there was a general congregation
of Regents and Non-Regents in St. Mary's Church,
in the beginning of which came the said Lawrence ’
witha Public Notary and witnesses to the appeal, and
there began to read it before them. No sooner had
he opened his mouth, but the Regent Master laid
hold on him and turned him and his witnesses out
of the Church and shut the doors close upon him.
