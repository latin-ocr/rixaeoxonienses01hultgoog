the Oxford market, and collegeS, both of ancient and

Earl of Leicester the right os nomination oi principals
of Halls was vested in the Chancellor and his suc-
cessors.

When, therefore, under the patronage of Queen
Elizabeth, Oxford began to show signs of revival, it
arose as an aristocratic institution; agroup os colleges,
holding within their gates societies under adequate
control; a University, from which the old popular

and cosmopolitan character had departed perhaps
for ever.
