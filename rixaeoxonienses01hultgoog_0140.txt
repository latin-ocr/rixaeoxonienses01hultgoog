128 Ranae Oxoniensen

On July 21, 1683, after the discovery 01 the alleged·
Rye House Plot, the University os Oxsord in Con-
vocation ‘condemned certain pernicious books and
damnable doctrines, as destructive to the sacred
persons 01 princes, their state and government and 01
all human society’3 and passed their celebrated
decree 01 non-resistance. At the same time Corpus
College caused the name 01 the Duke 01 Monmouth,
which he had entered in the college buttery book, to
be erased. On September 9, Thanksgiving Day, the
city had entertainment 01 wine, music, a barrel 01 ale
and a fire at Penniless Bench; in a pump below the
Star Inn was a tub set and ‘Presbyter' therein
preaching ; ‘all the srnart lads 01 the city marched
down the streets with cudgels in their hands crying
for the King, and the Dulce of York, and all the
people had “York” in their mouths, and his health
was drank publicly at most Halls after dinner.'

On the accession of James II the University raised
a troop 01 horse headed by Dr. Ailworth, Chancellor
of the diocese, to help the King against Monmouth,
and after the victory 01 Sedgemoor, bonfires were
built at Carfax, the Mayor and brethren proceeded in
state to hear prayer at St. Martin's Church, and
entertained with wine and biscuits the Earl 01 Abing·
don and the officers 01 militia. But all these expres·
sions 01 loyalty went for nought. James rode
roughshod over the privileges 01 the University,
created Massey, an avowed Papist, Dean 01 Christ
