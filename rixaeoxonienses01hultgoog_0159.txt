J ambite Oxford‚ 145

night before, the rabble at Bristol proclaimed the
Pretender‚ and committed several outrages on the
well-affected? 1t was apropos oi this occupation
oi Oxford‚ and a present oi books made about the
same time by the King to Cambridge, that the well
known lines were written:

Our royal master saw with heedfnl eyes

The wants os his two enimenim

Troops he to Oxiord sent, as knowing why
That learned body wanted loyalty3

But books to Cambridge gave, as well discerning
How that h'ght loyal body wanted learning·

and the Cambridge repartee:

The king to Oxford sent a troop of horse
For Tories own no argument but force.
With equal care to Cambridge books he sent
For Whigs allow no soree but argument.

While Colonel Handyside’s regiment remained at
Oxford‚ two serious riots occurred. On the 29th ol
May 1716 ‘the Constitution Club and several officers
met together at theKing’s Head Tavem. Whilst
they were engaged in drinking the King's health and
other loyal toasts‚ several squibs were thrown in at
the window which burnt some oi their cloaks and
filled the room with smoke. Besides this, they were
continually insulted with loud peals oi hisses and
condemnations of“ Down with the Roundheads ” from
the gownsmen and other disorderly persons in the
street, of which they took no notice. They continued

together till about eleven of the clock or not quite so
