Jacobite Oxfora'. 141

On the presentation to His Majesty, ol an address
by the University‚ the king answered‚ ‘That‚ as they
had shewn an open disrespect for His Majesty's
person and government in their late conduct, His
Majesty expected they should satisfy him better ol
their loyalty by their future behaviour, before they
attempted it by words'

On Aug. 18, ‘an officer beating up in Oxiord lor
volunteer dragoons, was hissed all round the town;
when he came against Balliol College, and was
making his proclamation, a vast crowd ol people
surrounded him, amongst whom were many scholars,
who hissed him and cried out, “an Ormond,'' “down
with the Roundheads‚ down with thern to the ground.'’
This made the poor sellow and his drummer to look
very sillily. However, they went lorward‚ and after
sometime, when they came across “the Angel,'’ in
the east in High Street, the south side of the way,
a gentleman that was in the inn, came out with a
naked sword and challenged the officer, and forced
him to cry, “an Ormond,’' “ God bless the Duke of
Ormond ”3 which the poor sellow did, though in a
sheepish poor-spirited manner, adding, “ Sir, I am ior
the Duke os Ormond,l believe, as well as you are.”
This occasioned a great crowd and throng of people,
all crying out “ an Ormond,'’ ‘⁴ Down with the Round-
heads,'’ at which, a certain noted Roundhead‚ com-
monly called “My Lord Shaltesbury,'' came out ol his
shop, under pretext ol inquiring into the occasion
