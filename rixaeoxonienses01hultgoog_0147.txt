Jacobite. Oxford. 133

James III their lawsul king ; the queen was alleged
to have given leave to the French ambassador to
raise a regiment os 1000 men in England sor the
king’s guards to attend him at his landing, and 700 were
said to be already enlisted and quartered in Southwark.

Tory efforts were however unavailing; on August
3, 1714, Queen Anne died, and the following day
the Elector ol' Brunswick was proclaimed king, at
Carfax and before St. Mary’s, to the disappointed
Oxonians3 the attendance ol' masters and doctors
at the solemnity was very small; there was very
little rejoicing or illumination ol houses. The Mayor,
who had been cautioned in a letter, signed ‘Legion
ior we are many,’ against proclaiming any king but
James 111, went through the form ol' offering a
reward of ί 100 sor the apprehension ol ‘a person in
an open-sleeved gown and a cinnamon-coloured coat‚’
who was supposed to have been the bearet.

Oxford now became the centre of the English
Jacobites. ‘War and destruction were denounced on
the Whigs3 libels, songs and lampoons were made
upon the government. Common-rooms and coffee
houseS, which during the preceding fifty years had
been increasing and multiplying‚ were hot-beds of
sedition' Numerous clubs had os late years been

founded3 the Poetical Club; the Nonsense Club;

the Banterers (¹ who made it their employment to talk
at a venture, lie and prate what nonsense they pleased ;
isa man talked seriously, they talked fluidlynonsense‚ .
