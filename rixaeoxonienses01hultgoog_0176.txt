The sheriff, who was alleged to have shown undue
partiality during the election to the Yellows, delayed
to commence the scrutiny till the 9th of May, and
then ordered that the Yellows should hrst make their
objections through the whole poll, thus allowing the
Blues no time to make their protests.

Finally, the sheriff returned all the four candidates
in one instrument, and the matter was referred to
Parliament for decision. After much delay, and after
’ arguments on both sides, Lord Parker and Sir Edward
Tumer were, on the 23rd of March 1755, voted to have
been duly elected.

From this date jacobitism rapidly died out, and
probably the last outward sign of it, was the electiori
to the Chancellorship in 1759 of Lord Westmoreland,
a recent convert from Whig principles. To judge by
the slightly fulsome addresses¹ presented to George
III, the University had already become Hanoverian‚
before the entry of Henry Stuart into the Roman
Catholic Church, and the death in 1788 of Charles
Edward without an heir, finally extinguished the
dying hopes of the jacobite party. Already in 1768
the change must have been noticeable. In that year,
the speaker of the House of Commons, in repri-
manding the Mayor of Oxford for offering to sell
the representation of the City to anyone who would
pay the municipal debt, remarked as follows, ‘many
circumstances concur to aggravate your offence. The
place of your residence was a singular advantage.
